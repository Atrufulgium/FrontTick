FrontTick gotchas
=================
- FrontTick currently targets Minecraft 1.19.4.
- My F5 button builds the thing and runs it with the following command line args:  
  `-c ./IngameTests -m ./MCMirror -w FrontTick`  
  Especially the `FrontTick` part may need to be updated as it needs to be a valid Minecraft world save directory name.
- FrontTick doesn't use Roslyn too intuitively, it instead builds an abstraction layer above with `XXXWalker` and `XXXRewriter` classes with dependencies that get executed in order.  
  At this point the order is a mess and I only know it due to the compiler output.
- In a lot of places you care about types. Unfortunately, importing them from MCMirror directly is not an option. For that reason, the `MCMirrorTypes.cs` file holds *manual* definitions of stuff *manually* annotated `[CompilerUsesName]` which you can then use in `CurrentSemantics.TypesMatch(node, MCMirrorTypes.Whatever)` or something.
- You (or rather, I) can't build the `MCMirror` directory manually in VS, see [the batch file](./Compiler/mcmirror_to_dll.bat).
- Do a little prayer if you need to touch `GotoFlagifyRewriter.cs`.

Roslyn gotchas
==============
- Don't try to guess what syntax trees should look like, just use [Roslyn Quoter](roslynquoter.azurewebsites.net).
- Creating a compilation requires you to reference *all* dlls you need, including the basic stuff that defines `System` etc, it doesn't do it for you.  
  (For me this is an upside because I don't need them.)
- *All* Roslyn syntax factory methods are the name of the thing without the word `Syntax`. This is usually obvious, but this convention also holds for things like `SeparatedSyntaxList` â†’ `SeparatedList()`.
- Getting an `InvalidCastException` during tree traversal means that some of the other `VisitXXX` methods returned something unexpected.  
  For example, visiting a `BinaryOperationExpression` and returning some `StatementSyntax` throws this.
- Semantic interpretation is a bit obnoxious. For instance, you cannot get the type belonging to some *statement*, instead you need to get it from its corresponding *expression*. It just doesn't walk to the nearest thing returning something non-null, it expects you to know how it works.
- (There was something annoying with `SyntaxKind`, but I forgot.)
